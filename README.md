## Repository:

This is my private repository for the processing of all given tasks in the context of the lecture "Software Engineering". 
A change of third parties is explicitly "NOT" desired here. Comments and improvements are welcome.

## Personal note:

Since we upload solutions created by us, we do not guarantee the correctness of the solutions. Furthermore, we do not give any warranty on the complete solution according to the ideas of the task creator. This repository should serve as a help if someone gets stuck or someone would like to have an alternative solution to a task or problem. In addition, this repository is used for the official submission to the course creator.

## Own recommendation:

Herewith we would like to point out expressly that I see the independent solving of the tasks nevertheless as recommendable. Because only the independent solving of the tasks can various comprehension problems be recognized and cleaned up themselves. 

## Other:

Development environment: VSCode <br />
Diagramming program: Drawio <br />
Extention in VSCode: Draw.io Integration <br />
